MLP regression network for chess position evaluation

This code describes a MLP reggression network that it's able to evaluate any chess position. To do so it's esential to 
have a train set with a high number of chess positions to train to neural network. 

With a set of 10000 positions this is the result comparing it to stockfish evaluation (in centipawns):

The idea of the application is to use it in the future to develop a chess ai that choose the move to play next.
